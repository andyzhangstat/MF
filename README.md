# Matrix Factorization for Recommendation System



This repository contains implementations of key matrix factorization algorithms, including:
- Alternating Least Squares (ALS),

- Gradient Descent (GD),

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).



These algorithms are applied to both simulated data and the MovieLens dataset to demonstrate their effectiveness.
